\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

LightLogR is a package under development as part of the MeLiDos project aimed at developing a standard workflow for wearable light logger data and optical radiation dosimeters. MeLiDos is a joint, EURAMET-funded project involving sixteen partners across Europe. Its primary contributions towards fostering FAIR data include the development of a common file format, robust metadata descriptors, and an accompanying open-source software ecosystem.
