\usage{
Brown.rec(
  state,
  Brown.day = "day",
  Brown.evening = "evening",
  Brown.night = "night",
  Brown.day.th = 250,
  Brown.evening.th = 10,
  Brown.night.th = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{The state from Brown et al. (2022). Needs to be a character vector.}

\item{Brown.day, Brown.evening, Brown.night}{The names of the states from Brown et al. (2022). These are the default values (\code{"day"}, \code{"evening"}, \code{"night"}), but can be changed if the names in \code{state} are different. Needs to be a character scalar.}

\item{Brown.day.th, Brown.evening.th, Brown.night.th}{The thresholds for the states from Brown et al. (2022). These are the default values (\code{250}, \code{10}, \code{1}), but can be changed if the thresholds should be different. Needs to be a numeric scalar.}
}
\value{
df A dataframe with the same length as \code{state} that contains the recommended illuminance/MEDI levels.
}
\description{
This is a lower level function. It calculates the recommended illuminance/MEDI levels by Brown et al. (2022) for a given state. The function is vectorized.
}
\examples{
states <- c("day", "evening", "night")
Brown.rec(states)
Brown.rec(states, Brown.day.th = 100)
