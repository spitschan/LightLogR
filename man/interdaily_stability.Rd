\title{Interdaily stability (IS)}
\usage{
interdaily_stability(
  Light.vector,
  Datetime.vector,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  as.df = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Light.vector}{Numeric vector containing the light data.}

\item{Datetime.vector}{Vector containing the time data. Must be POSIXct.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Should missing values be removed? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{as.df}{Logical. Should the output be returned as a data frame? Defaults
to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric value or dataframe with column 'IS'.
}
\description{
This function calculates the variability of 24h light exposure patterns across
multiple days. Calculated as the ratio of the variance of the average daily
pattern to the total variance across all days. Calculated for mean hourly
light levels. Ranges between 0 (Gaussian noise) and 1 (Perfect Stability).
}
\details{
Note that this metric will always be 1 if the data contains only one 24 h day.
}
\examples{

set.seed(1)
N <- 24 * 7
# Calculate metric for seven 24 h days with two measurements per hour
dataset1 <-
  tibble::tibble(
    Id = rep("A", N * 2),
    Datetime = lubridate::as_datetime(0) + c(lubridate::minutes(seq(0, N * 60 - 30, 30))),
    MEDI = sample(1:1000, N * 2)
  )

  dplyr::summarise(
    "Interdaily stability" = interdaily_stability(MEDI, Datetime)
