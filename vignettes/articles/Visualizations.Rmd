```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

This article focuses on various ways to visualize personal light exposure data with `LightLogR`. It is important to note that `LightLogR` is using the `ggplot2` package for visualizations. This means that all the `ggplot2` functions can be used to further customize the plots.
The following packages are needed for the analysis:

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(LightLogR)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Importing Data

We will use data imported and cleaned already in the article [Import & Cleaning](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/articles/Import.html).

```{r, import}
data <- readRDS("cleaned_data/ll_data.rds")
```

# gg_overview()

As can be seen by using `gg_overview()`, the dataset contains 17 ids with one weeks worth of data each, and one to three participants per week.

```{r, overview}
data %>% gg_overview()
```
