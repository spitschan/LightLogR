  - title: Import
    desc: >
      Wearable light logger data can be imported from a variety of sources, i.e., 
      exports from measurement devices or online databases. This section also
      includes functions to import auxiliary data, such as sleep/wake data. 
      The family of import functions works on a variety of device-specific files 
      through `import.*()`.
