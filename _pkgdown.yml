  - title: Import
    desc: >
      Wearable light logger data can be imported from a variety of sources, i.e., 
      exports from measurement devices or online databases. This section also
      includes functions to import auxiliary data, such as sleep/wake data. 
      The family of import functions works on a variety of device-specific files 
      through `import.*()`.

  - title: Insight
    desc: >
      This section includes functions to gain more insight into light logger. 
      Functions in this section will not return a version of the input dataset, 
      but rather information based on it.

  - title: Validate & Process
    desc: >
      This section includes functions to process light logger data, e.g., to
      validate and clean data, to filter, cut or aggreagate data, or to join 
      datasets. All of these functions will return a version of the input dataset.
