# LightLogR 0.2.1.9000

* Added the `filter_Datetime_multiple()` function to filter for multiple Datetime ranges depending on certain conditions, e.g. different filter cutoffs for different participants.

* Reworked the internals of the light logger data import functions. They now use a more straightforward function factory approach. For users the only visible change it that device specific functions now have the form `import$device()` instead of the old `import.device()`.

* Added the `symlog_trans()` function from a [post on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14674703). This function leads to a better visualization of light logger data, as a logarithmic transformation is necessary, but values of 0 are common. The function was integrated as a default for `gg_day()` and will likely be the basis of upcoming visualization functions.

* Added the `aggregate_Datetime()` function to aggregate data to a given time interval.

* Added the `gg_overview()` function to get a sense for the timeframe of measurement data.

* Added the family of `regularize` functions to find and deal with implicit missing data. These functions include `dominant_epoch()`, `gapless_Datetimes()`, `gap_handler()`, and `gap_finder()`. 

* A ton of updates to documentation, unit tests, and bug fixes.

# LightLogR 0.2.0.9000

* Added Unit tests and documentation for all new functions.

* To `filter_Datetime()` and `filter_Date()` added the option to filter for group specific dates.

* Added the family of functions around `States` and `Reference` to import, process, and add states to light logger data, like sleep/wake times, wear times, or other data. This family includes `import.Statechanges()`, `sc2interval()`, `ìnterval2state()`, `data2reference()`, `sleep.int2Brown()`, `Brown.check()`, `Brown.rec()`, and `Brown2reference()`. 

* Added the Article/Vignette "What´s in a Day" to demonstrate the LightLogR workflow.

* Added the convenience function `create_Time.data()` to create a Time-of-Day column in datasets.

* Added the family of `filter_Datetime()`, `filter_Date()` and `filter_Time()` functions to easily filter datasets.

* Added unit tests for the first functions.

* Added several helper functions to work with states like sleep or wear times.

* Added an automatic ID creation at import and streamlined the `import` functions.

* Added the function `join.datasets` to combine imported datasets with sensible constraints.

# LightLogR 0.1.1.9000

## `gg_day()`:
* Added `major grid marks` for the y-axis.

* Added a `message` when using start or end dates to make it clear, that only the Date portion of the input will be used.

* Changed the behavior, when there is already a Day.data column present in the data. It will only create a new column if none is present, otherwise it will use the existing column for faceting (after factorization)

* Added the option to create an `interactive` plot by feeding the plot to the [plotly] package.

# LightLogR 0.1.0.9000

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
