Description: LightLogR is a package under development as part of the MeLiDos 
    project aimed at developing a standard workflow for wearable light logger 
    data and optical radiation dosimeters. MeLiDos is a joint, EURAMET-funded 
    project involving sixteen partners across Europe. Its primary contributions 
    towards fostering FAIR data include the development of a common file format, 
    robust metadata descriptors, and an accompanying open-source software 
    ecosystem.
