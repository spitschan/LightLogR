Personalized light exposure data is progressively gaining importance in various sectors, including research, occupational affairs, and fitness tracking. Data are collected through a proliferating selection of wearable loggers and dosimeters, varying in size, shape, functionality, and output format. Despite or maybe because of numerous use cases, the field lacks a unified framework for collecting, validating, and analyzing the accumulated data. This issue increases the time and expertise necessary to handle such data and also compromises the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) of the results, especially in meta-analyses.

##### Please note that LightLogR is work in progress! If you are interested in the project and want to know more, please give us a [message](mailto:johannes.zauner@tum.de)

**LightLogR** is a package under development as part of the [*MeLiDos*](https://www.melidos.eu) project to address these issues. MeLiDos is a joint, [EURAMET](https://www.euramet.org)-funded project involving sixteen partners across Europe, aimed at developing a metrology and a standard workflow for wearable light logger data and optical radiation dosimeters. Its primary contributions towards fostering FAIR data include the development of a common file format, robust metadata descriptors, and an accompanying open-source software ecosystem. **LightLogR** aims to provide tools for:

-   Generation of data and metadata files

-   Conversion of popular file formats

-   Validation of light logging data

-   Verification of crucial metadata

-   Calculation of common parameters

-   Semi-automated analysis and visualization (both command-line and GUI-based)

-   Integration of data into a unified database for cross-study analyses

**LightLogR** is developed by the [*Translational Sensory & Circadian Neuroscience*](https://www.tscnlab.org) lab, a joint group from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) and the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](https://www.mpg.de/152075/biological-cybernetics).

## Installation

You can install the development version of LightLogR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tscnlab/LightLogR")
```

## Example

Here is a quick starter on how do use **LightLogR**.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(LightLogR)
#these packages are just needed for the examples as shown.
library(gt)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


### Import
You can import a light logger dataset with ease. The import functions give quick, helpful feedback about the dataset.

```{r}
filename <- system.file("extdata/sample_data_LYS.csv", package = "LightLogR")
dataset <- import.LYS(filename)

dataset %>% select(Datetime, lux, kelvin, mEDI) %>%  slice(7500:7505) %>% gt()
```

### Visualize
Once imported, **LightLogR** allows you conveniently visualize the data.

```{r, fig.retina=2}
dataset %>% gg_day(y.axis = mEDI)
```
There is a wide range of options to the `gg_day` function to customize the output
```{r, fig.retina=2}
dataset %>% gg_day(y.axis = mEDI, col = mEDI >= 250, scales = "fixed")
dataset %>% 
  gg_day(y.axis = mEDI, scales = "fixed", geom = "line", format.day = "%d/%m/%Y")
```
### Reference data
The built-in dataset `sample.data.environment` shows a combined dataset of light logger data and simultaneous reference data - in this case unobstructed outdoor light measurements. The data can, again, be easily visualized with `gg_day`. The `col` parameter used on the `Source` column of the dataset allows for a color separation between types of data.

```{r, fig.height= 6, fig.retina=2}
sample.data.environment %>% 
  gg_day(
    end.date = "2023-08-18",
    y.axis = `MELANOPIC EDI`,
    col = Source,
    scales = "fixed",
    geom = "line")
```
With the `cut_Datetime` function, the data can further be broken up into arbitrary time intervals. This can be used to easily compare different datasets. Just put the function in between the dataset. This makes a new variable available for plotting: `Datetime.rounded`. Just make sure, that the `geom` parameter is set to *boxplot* and the `group` parameter uses both the info from the rounded time interval (`Datetime.rounded`) and the different datasets (`Source`). The `interaction` function can easily combine them. The default interval from `cut_Datetime` is 3 hours.
```{r, fig.retina=2}
sample.data.environment %>% 
  cut_Datetime() %>% 
  gg_day(
    end.date = "2023-08-15",
    y.axis = `MELANOPIC EDI`,
    col = Source,
    scales = "fixed",
    geom = "boxplot",
    group = interaction(Source, Datetime.rounded)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 24*60*60))
```
